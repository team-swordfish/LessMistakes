# Less Mistakes

Langage
-------
The english language is very complicated. And so is git repos.

Standardization is important, no compromisations are allowed. Mixing of internationalizations should be harmonised.

## Coding

* Too many whitespace.

** Code is too spaced out and file navigation is difficult

* Not enough whitespaces

** Code is not spaced out enough and its difficult to read

*** Code should be grouped so things which are related are together in the same block of code to aid understanding of the code's function and allowing for easy extraction of code into another method if this was deemed to be appropriate at some point in the future, which would be the case if the code is repeated many times and in many places and the code could be extracted to avoid duplicating the code.

* variable names.

** More then one letter


* Self documenting code

* ToDo: is there more ?
